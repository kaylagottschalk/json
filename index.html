	<h1>Object Prototypes</h1>
	<p>JavaScript objects inherit features from one another using Prototypes. Each and every <code>object</code> features a <code>prototype</code> object that functions as a template from which it inherits methods and properties. Such objects may also contain their own <code>prototype</code> objects from which they <em>also</em> inherit various methods and properties…and so on. This chain of inheritance is called the <dfn>prototype chain</dfn>.</p>

		var output = document.getElementById('output');

		/* STEP 1: Create an object (looks a lot like declaring a variable, but with empty braces), then open this page in a browser and enter 'Coffee' in the console */
		function Coffee(size, isDecaf, qtyCream, qtySugar) {
			this.size = size;
			this.isDecaf = isDecaf;
			this.qtyCream = qtyCream;
			this.qtySugar = qtySugar;

			this.decaf = (this.isDecaf === true ? decaffienated)
		}
		/* STEP 2: Instatiate a coffee based on the above constructor function */
		var scottsCoffee = new Coffee('large', false, 2, 1);
		/* STEP 3: Refresh the page, and in the console, begin to call a method on scottsCoffee by typing 'scottsCoffee.' - look at all the members and methods */

		/* STEP 4: Enter into the console, scottsCoffee.valueOf() and look at the result. scottsCoffee doesn't have such a method, and neither does the constructor function, 'Coffee'. But the 'Object' object does - so through inheritance, scottsCoffee has access to the method, valueOf(). */

		/* STEP 5a: Each object has a prototype member that isn't really directly accessible, but it can be referenced using the deprecated '__proto__' - using a double underscore on either side of the word 'proto'. Try it - scottsCoffee.__proto__.__proto__ */

		/* STEP 5b: The more modern way to do this is … Object.getPrototypeOf(scottsCoffee) - try THIS in the console */

		/* STEP 5c: EVERYTHING is an object in JavaScript. Try accessing the prototype property of Coffee (which even though it is a constructor function it is still an object) with Coffee.prototype in the console. Then try Object.Prototype */

		/* STEP 6a: Let's circle back to create() - use scottsCoffee to create a new object instance - one based on scottsCoffee. */
		var richsCoffee = Object.create(scottsCoffee);

		/* STEP 6b: See how this new object inherits from the prototype with richsCoffee.__proto__ in the console. */

		/* STEP 7a: Each constructor function includes a prototype property with a value equal to an object that contains a constructor property. Try it out by typing scottsCoffee.constructor and richsCoffee.constructor */

		/* STEP 7b: Since constructor is also a function, you can use it to create a new object instance - try it! */
		var kathysCoffee = new richsCoffee.constructor('small', true, 1, 0);

		/* STEP 7c: Attempt via the console to access the new object's properties - kathysCoffee.size, kathysCoffee.isDecaf, etc. */

		/* STEP 7d: Now see if the new object can access the description() method… */
		kathysCoffee.description();

		/* STEP 7e: The constructor has other features - try using it to discover the name of an instance's constructor by typing kathysCoffee.constructor.name into the console. */

		/* STEP 8a: We can modify the prototype property of a constructor function - let's add another method to Coffee */
		Coffee.prototype.thanks = function() {
			output.textContent = 'Thanks for a great ' + this.size + ' coffee!';
		}
		// What's really interesting about the above code is that every instance based on the Coffee constructor has been updated due to prototypical inheritance!

		/* STEP 8b: Now let's call up this method on one or more of our Coffee instances from the console (scottsCoffee, richsCoffee, or kathysCoffee). */


		// Next, open up coffee.html and we will put prototypical inheritance to work.
